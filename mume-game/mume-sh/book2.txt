In the wild, strange plants with peculiar properties can be found. One of these
plants is the phosphorescent moss. The moss covers the walls inside some of
Arda's humid caves. It is believed that the light emitted from the moss comes
from a fungus, which lives in symbiosis with the moss. This moss can be used to
prepare a draught which gives an enhanced ability to see in the night.

The base of this concoction is the brown powder of a cinnamon stalk. To it, add
a handful of rosemary leaves, these make the mind more attentive.

Add shreds of humidified phosphorescent moss to the dry concoction, and
carefully mix them together, until you have a phosphorescent liquid which
emanates a pale light.

When consuming it, you will be able to perceive your environment more
effectively, especially in the darkness, thanks to the moss. A side effect of
its activity is to weaken you for a while, as it draws energy from your body.
The effects can be felt for several days.
As you finish reading it, a runic book crumbles to dust.
